ChatGPT 说：  This repository contains LAMMPS molecular dynamics simulation codes for studying mechanical behaviors, including uniaxial loading, cyclic loading, crack propagation, rigid-body impact, and shockwave impact. Some key parts have been removed or modified, but I can provide the full code upon request—please contact me via email if needed.
