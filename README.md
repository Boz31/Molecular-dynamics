# Molecular-dynamics
This repository contains LAMMPS molecular dynamics simulation codes for studying mechanical behaviors, including uniaxial loading, cyclic loading, crack propagation, rigid-body impact, and shockwave impact. Some key parts have been removed or modified, but I can provide the full code upon requestâ€”please contact me via email if needed.

First, it should be noted that single crystals can be modeled directly in LAMMPS in most cases, whereas polycrystals require modeling with external software such as Atomsk. I highly recommend using Atomsk for modeling, as it is beneficial for setting up detailed structural models.
